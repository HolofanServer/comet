FRWI License - A Comprehensive, Overly Detailed, Yet Essentially Standard License for Software Usage

Copyright (c) 2024 FreeWiFiTech

To all human beings, extraterrestrials, AI entities, or any other form of conscious or unconscious being capable of interacting with this software (henceforth referred to as "Users"), permission is hereby granted, absolutely free of charge, without any need for monetary or other compensation, to any User obtaining a copy of this software and the accompanying files, including but not limited to the code, documentation, configuration files, and anything else that might be included within the same directory or distributed together as a unified package (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Software").

Users are granted an unprecedented level of freedom, including but not limited to the following rights:

- The right to use the Software for any and all purposes, including but not limited to personal, professional, educational, recreational, and philosophical endeavors.
- The right to modify the Software, whether it be adding new features, removing existing ones, or simply rearranging the code to suit one’s aesthetic preferences.
- The right to merge this Software with other software, creating amalgamations of code that may or may not be functional, as long as Users are happy with the results.
- The right to publish and distribute this Software, whether in its original form or in an altered state, via any medium known or unknown to humankind, including but not limited to the internet, floppy disks, or smoke signals.
- The right to sublicense the Software to others, even if those others are unaware that they’ve been sublicensed.
- The right to sell copies of the Software for any price Users deem fit, whether it be one cent, one million dollars, or something else entirely, such as an exchange for a lifetime supply of chocolate.

All of the aforementioned rights are granted subject to the following conditions, which Users must adhere to with the utmost diligence:

1. The above copyright notice, which is probably the most important part of this whole document, must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software, even if those copies are incomplete, fragmented, or otherwise altered beyond recognition. This ensures that the original authors (that’s us) receive the recognition they deserve, or at least some degree of acknowledgment.

2. This permission notice, which is the part you’re reading right now, must also be included in all distributed copies of the Software, because we wouldn’t want anyone to forget that they have all these amazing rights.

Now, it’s time to get serious (for a moment). THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY (WHATEVER THAT MEANS), FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (LIKE USING THIS SOFTWARE TO CONTROL A SPACESHIP), AND NON-INFRINGEMENT (DON’T BLAME US IF YOU GET SUED).

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS, COPYRIGHT HOLDERS, OR ANY ENTITY REMOTELY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SOFTWARE BE LIABLE FOR ANY KIND OF DAMAGES (PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, FINANCIAL, OR OTHERWISE), WHETHER DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR COSMIC (YES, EVEN THAT). THIS INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, WHETHER IT INVOLVES DATA LOSS, FIRE, FLOOD, ALIEN INVASION, OR ANY OTHER UNFORESEEABLE CATASTROPHE THAT MIGHT OCCUR.

USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK. NO REALLY, WE MEAN IT.

In conclusion, while this Software comes with virtually no restrictions, responsibilities, or guarantees, we hope you’ll enjoy using it, modifying it, or simply pondering its existence. And if you do manage to create something amazing with it, feel free to let us know. Or not. Either way, we’ll keep doing our thing, and you can keep doing yours.

Good luck, and may the Wi-Fi be ever in your favor.
